    <h2 class="about-info">
        <p> This project is a test site built on Django, created for learning and experimenting with web development. It started completely from scratch: I had no prior knowledge of web development, and the site was built gradually while learning technologies along the way.</p>

        <p> Technologies used:
The site is built using the Django framework, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interactive features.</p>
Personal touch / humor:
        <p>This project was created as a learning and portfolio piece. Improvements and new features are welcome!
Developed by Alex with the help of ChatGPT just to get familiar with web development.</p>
